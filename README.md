# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Using-CNN

Here we used Google colabratory to perform the code. At first, we had to upload our dataset via google drive . Then from there  we fetched our dataset from train and valid folder.

We build a sequential model of 7 layers which will train the dataset of FER-2013. After training our dataset we constructed a pretrained model called Emotion_Little_vgg.h5. This(Emotion_Little_vgg.h5)
will be used as the pretrained dataset for the testing portion of our code.
